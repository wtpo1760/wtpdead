        <h4><span class="IMHO">In my opinion,</span> all government agencies are open to new ideas on how to fulfill the work of the government.</h4>
        <p>Just look around. The Supreme Court all the way to county administrators are being targeted by people unwilling to accept the Rule of Law. Regardless of <span class="IMHO">your opinions</span> on what is just or not, there are two ways to resolve problems.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="IMHO">My opinion is formed from my experience</span> as a former Business Manager, former Tribal Operations Secretary at <a href="https://www.lyttonrancheria.com/" target="_new">Lytton Rancheria</a>, former Contract Administrator for the <a href="http://www.oakha.org/residents/public_housing/pages/default.aspx" target="_new">Oakland Housing Authority</a>, former Secretary for <a href="http://www.genesisca.org" target="_new">Genesis in Oakland</a>, former Secretary, Minister, and Committee Member at <a href="https://fccolovefirst.org/" target="_new">First Congregational Church of Oakland, CA</a>. I was trained in community organizing by <a href="https://www.gamaliel.org" target="_new">Gamaliel</a>, a faith-based group <a href="https://www.essence.com/celebrity/community-organizers-barack-obama/" target="_new">who trained Barak Obama</a> .

            <p>I am always open to hear ideas from other people but, I will not blindly endorse a plan from anyone without reviewing and evaluating to form <span class="IMHO">my own opinion</span>.</p>
            <p>A few times, Margo asked if I would support her plan. I told her before I could, I had questions. Unfortunately, we never had an opportunity to discuss those questions, so I am left with providing <span class="IMHO">my opinion</span> on <a href="imgz1760/RCAmm/RCA-no-link.pdf">the version of her RCA Proposal she said she was presenting to the City of San Francisco</a>.</p>
        </div>        
        <p><span class="IMHO">In my opinion,</span>&nbsp;the <a href="imgz1760/RCAmm/RCA-no-link.pdf" target="_new">RCA Proposal</a> is a narrative that identifies some of HUD's problems and its need for modernization but in its current form does not appear to be a well-planned and plotted implementation plan for creating a privately funded layer of oversight on an exisiting multi-jurisdiction agency tasked with providing independent financial oversight and proper elections, as required by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-24/subtitle-B/chapter-IX/part-964?toc=1" target="_new">the Code of Federal Regulations Title 24 Part 964</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="IMHO">I think</span> the <a href="imgz1760/RCAmm/RCA-no-link.pdf" target="_new">RCA Proposal</a> <strong>would need to address several topics, including:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Clarify the Objective and Scope:</strong>
          </li>
          <ul>- Define the specific goals of replacing the agency.</ul>
          <ul>- Outline the scope of the changes and the jurisdictions involved.</ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal and Regulatory Compliance:</strong>
          </li>
          <ul>- Ensure compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations Title 24 Part 964.</ul>
          <ul>- Identify and address any legal and regulatory requirements for financial oversight and election procedures.</ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Governance Structure:</strong>
          </li>
          <ul>- Develop a new governance structure that ensures independent financial oversight.</ul>
          <ul>- Establish clear roles and responsibilities for overseeing proper elections.</ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Stakeholder Engagement:</strong>
          </li>
          <ul>- Engage with stakeholders, including residents, local authorities, and federal agencies, to gather input and build support.</ul>
          <ul>- Establish communication channels to keep stakeholders informed throughout the implementation process.</ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Transition Plan:</strong>
          </li>
          <ul>- Develop a detailed transition plan that outlines the steps for phasing out the existing agency and establishing the new oversight body.</ul>
          <ul>- Include timelines, milestones, and key deliverables.</ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Resource Allocation:</strong>
          </li>
          <ul>- Identify the resources required for the transition, including personnel, budget, and technology.</ul>
          <ul>- Develop a budget and allocate resources accordingly.</ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Risk Management:</strong>
          </li>
          <ul>- Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.</ul>
          <ul>- Establish a risk management plan to address any issues that arise during the transition.</ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Monitoring and Evaluation:</strong>
          </li>
          <ul>- Develop a plan for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the new oversight body.</ul>
          <ul>- Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and reporting mechanisms.</ul>
        </ol>
        <p>The <strong>RCA Proposal</strong> is the Aauthoring Team's perspective of the root cause of problems and issues arising from implementing the HUD/RAD program, but it does not provide a path for or sources of funding, staffing requirements, or a propose a clear path for implementation of a plan should one arise.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the <strong>RCA Proposal</strong> does not specify the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A legitimate source for the "Training Materials" to be implemented</li>
            <li>References to any sources, accredited training programs, or recognized experts in the field to support the Objective and Scope, should one arise.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="IMHO">I think</span> that for a proposal to be considered legitimate in terms of training materials, it should include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Disclosure of funding source</li>
          <li>Credentials for any of the Trainers</li>
          <li>Examples of relevant training material</li>
          <li>References to reputable sources for any claims regarding organizational efficiency or inefficiency</li>
          <li>Listing of issues that this proposal would address</li>
          <li>Referencing existing and proven accredited HUD/RAD Tenant Association training programs, or any recognized experts in the field</li>
        </ul>
