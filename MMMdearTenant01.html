  <h4>This Letter to Tenants at 1760 has several false claims that need to be called out.</h4>
  <p>WTPO1760 have done our best to verify our information and publish only what we can verify with documentation or other imperical evidence.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4>Residents have no way to engage with Margo before or after she posts these "Newsletters"</h4>
  <hr />
  <h4>We the Residents of 1760 have no input about</h4>
  <ul style="font-weight: 600;">
    <li>The advocacy work Margo conducts in Our Name at 1760 Bush</li>
    <li>What meetings she goes to as 1760 TA President</li>
    <li><a href="MMMexpenses.html" target="_new">What she spends money on</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>And how does any of that improve the quality of our daily lives</h4>
  <hr />
  <h4>Margo was appointed to San Francisco's Homeless Oversight Commission, Seat 11</h4>
  <p><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong>Why did Margo exclude the announce of this appointment from these newsletters and post in the Community Bulletin Board? Why would she not want any tenants from 1760 Bush to attend the Nomination?</p>
  <h5>Maybe because she threw CCSD under MUNI. You can watch for yourself:</h5>
  <p class="myList">At a public meeting of <a href="https://hsh.sfgov.org/about/commission-and-committees/homelessness-oversight-commission/" target="_new">The Homeless Oversight Committee</a> on April 4, 2024,<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">- CCSD had <a href="CCSDcause.html" target="_new">problems since 2022</a> with the Interm President</span><br /><a href="https://archive.org/details/SFGTV_20240421_070000_Homelessness_Oversight_Commission/start/6540/end/6600" target="_new">Margo announced she is president of CCSD</a>, then declared them dysfunctional [under her leadership], slandered the Board's financial management, and immediately tried to introduce a motion to implement her <a href="imgz1760/RCAmm/RCAcolor2024.pdf" target="_new">RCA Proposal</a> to <a href="#boss">"be their boss"</a> at CCSD.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4>Margo affirms <span class="mark"><a href="#stillCCSD">we are part of CCSD</a></span> as of May 2024</h4>
  <hr />
  <h4>True: CCSD does need change.</h4>
  <h4> ALL Boards need change or they become Autocratic and serve the special interests of those in power.</h4>
  <h5>Many members would agree that change is needed at CCSD. It needs Good Leaders, not oversight by <a href="RCAboth2024.html">a private company</a>.</h5>
  <p>CCSD was created by SFHA and it's mission is supported by SFHA and HUD under the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231128124220/https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/TENANTORGANIZINGAFTERRAD.PDF">RAD program</a>. What "The Plan for Change to Fix CCSD" looks like to each person is different, even for those who have similar goals. An Effective Leader knows how to organize work and delegate tasks as a Team Leader, not a Individual Decision Maker.</p>
  <p>The COVID Shutdown changed how each TA operated. Some went dormant and others found ways to stay active and supportive and some had minimal activity. After The COVID Shutdown, CCSD itself was trying to re-start from The COVID Shutdown. CCSD needed a leader who could re-engage with the Member TAs and access their needs, then work with the Board to plan out the course of action.</p>
  <p><strong>Margo's plan was to create a Board over the Board she was appointed to.</strong> She also holds on to an eight year old "Plan" by Beverly Saba. How that qualifies as "change" only Margo can answer that, and she has not yet.</p>
  <hr />
  <a id="whatWENTdown"></a>
  <h4>What happened at CCSD ...</h4>
  <p>At some point, CCSD pointed out to Margo <a href="./TAdocs/1760_Bylaw.html" target="_new">the 1760 Bylaws</a> and <a href="MMMexpenses.html" target="_new">1760 Approved Expenses</a> she submitted for both Training Material and the 1760 Bush Membership File were out of compliance. Margo refuses to accept the fact those documents are illegitimate or take steps to ensure her home TA has legitimate Bylaws and Approved Expenses.</p>
  <p>After several attempts by the CCSD Board for Margo to work with and not <a href="CCSDcause.html" target="_new">against the Board</a> failed, the Board moved to <a href="CCSDrecall.html" target="_new">Recalled Margo as Interm-President</a>.</p>

        <h4>MM at CCSD</h4>
        <p><a href="#01">Click Here</a></p>
      </div>
        <p>I'd like to alert you to a potentially big problem I am having with CC-S/D (Citywide Council Senior Disabled) is in disarray to put it mildly.</p>
        <p>Since becoming their president after six months, I thought I would be able to lead it to at least close to what Beverly Saba envisioned for the organization which she led to greatness for many years until her death.</p>
        <p>Since then CCSD has had a succession of ill-equipped Presidents, for example: Dennis Katrones (2018-2022) would fight loudly at Board meetings for a year combating Mary (Wu) his Secretary getting nothing done, setting the dysfunctional tone, finally taking the fight to Civil Court then having it thrown out. Next president Peter Kats saw the disorganization and quit... Then I came along.</p>
        <p>If you know me at all you know I have a deep seated concern for our Rights and our Community. Ever since I was homeless living on the streets for a year. I've garnered a healthy Attitude of Gratitude and I don't take our roof (or benefits) for granted.</p>
        <div class="bubblE2">
          <h4><strong>Correction from Ms Hale</strong></h4>
          <p><a href="#02">Director of Housing Services</a></p>
          <p><a href="#02">MM's Advocacy</a></p>
          <a id="033"></a>
        </div>
        <p>I am passionate regarding our human rights and our Tenant Rights now falling under HUD's Public-private subsidized housing laws and Section 8 (voucher program). I've consistently studied these new laws and the rights that come with them.I pride myself on being YOUR Advocate when you don't get anywhere with problems or concerns of your household. I study rent calculation and re-certification procedures and count myself <span class="mark">generally ready to represent our collective voices to The Housing Commissioners SFHA San Francisco Housing Authority and to Helen Hale now promoted to Director of the Mayor's Office on Housing</span></p>

          <p>I've continued to stay motivated to bring YOU the best environment for us to cohabitate,doing what I can to make our lives better here in Public-Private Housing.</p>

          <a id="055"></a>
        </div>
          <p>So I generally was looking forward to taking on the position as Leader for CCSD for a longtime.</p>

            <a id="066"></a>
          </div>
          <p>Now, not to [sic] sure. Every Board meeting I go to at CCSD ends in a practical fist fight. members insult each other, don't wait for their turn to talk, shout derogatory remarks and curse at each other. they act worse than children.How can they, or I, hope to get anything done? Their affiliates are pulling out one after another.</p>
          <div class="bubblE2">
            <h4><strong>Correction</strong></h4>
            <p><a href="#06">Ms. Hale's reply<br />when asked to verify</a></p>
            <a id="077"></a>
          </div>
          <p>However, armed with my tales of dysfunction, <span class="mark">I went to Helen Hale, whose job it is to sort out these things through. She actually said to me, Slow down, you're getting too much done.She actually asked me to not be so functional but instead to match the dysfunction of the Board. who are famous for not taking action between stipend checks, by the way.</p>
            <div class="bubblE2">
              <h4><strong>Unclear</strong></h4>
              <p><a href="#07">Ms. Hale is happy<br />and willing to answer<br />Resident's questions</a></p>
              <a id="099"></a>
            </div>
          <p>I asked Helen Hale What benefit would you possibly have to keep CCSD dysfunctional? and got no response. Now rumor tells me she has bought in with the builders or just given up on the effectiveness of any resident council. Now, it starts to make sense.</p>
          <div class="bubblE2">
            <h4><strong>FALSE</strong></h4>
            <p><a href="#00">Click here</a></p>
          </div>
          <p>Helen's vision is that if you have a problem or concern just go to Management. If they refuse to act, go to their supervisor. Tenants have met with retaliation when doing this in many instances and never receive confidentiality and their situations don't change.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Then I asked about security: I asked, Does the Owner have any responsibility to provide security? She stated, point blank: NO. Saying that it's not in our lease. Well, a little investigation further alerted me that these owners HAVE to swear their buildings are secure BEFORE receiving any money from HUD.Its #6 on the application!! She looked at my face, and lied</p>
          <div class="bubblE2">

            <a id="099"></a>
          </div>
          <p>My vision and the way it was explained to me was if a tenant has a problem they can't solve on your [sic] own, bring it to the Resident Council. If the Resident Council (your tenant association) can't do anything they bring it to CCSD to solve. If CCSD can't do anything to help, they bring the problem to the Commissioners, (who incidentally, put it on Helen's shoulders).</p>

          <p>Cue my proposal. I'm promoting CCSD have an Oversight Board in between them and the Commissioners, called Resident Council Advisors or RCA; needed to make sure CCSD is acting appropriately. That's how Democracy works. having Checks and balances of Offices.</p>

          <p>Our collective voice is at risk right now, but I believe we are stronger together! I'm losing hope that CCSD can be fixed on my own.They are furious with me for calling them out on the way they conduct themselves and may soon vote me out of being the president of CCSD. that's okay because <a id="boss">when my proposal gets approved, I'll be their boss</a>.

      <h4>1760 TA President Margo McNulty negotiated with CCSD to bring 1760 Bush back to CCSD in 2022.</h4>
      <p>In 2022, Margo negotiated with Dennis [then President of CCSD] for 1760 to rejoin CCSD. She was appointed CCSD Secretary to finish out 2022. Past due "Tech Funds" would be forgiven, and 1760 would then resume dues in 2023.</p>
      <p>From CCSD: 1760 Tenants did voted to Leave CCSD in 2016, but unfortunately never completed the formal paperwork to exit. The notarized document used to confirm the vote to exit happened is not the formal disassociation documentation formalizing 1760 Bush dissolving the agreement with CCSD [formerly part of SFHA]</p>
      <p>After being appointed Interm President of CCSD, she agreed to bring 2023 Tech Funds for 1760 Bush.</p>
      <p>CCSD records show Interm President recieved a stipend from CCSD since previous appointment as Secretary in 2022.</p>

    <p>Its easy <span style="font-style: italic;">two</span> make a mistake. Ms. Hale's title is "Director of Housing Services". Her official title is:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Helen M. Hale</strong><br />Director of Housing Services<br />Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development<br />City and County of San Francisco<br />and her email is: <a href="mailto:helen.hale@sfgov.org">helen.hale@sfgov.org</a></p>

    <h4>Rent Calculations & Re-Certification</h4>
    <p>Annual re-certification and rent calculation will resume now the quarantine is lifted. The new HUD/RAD program will [hopefully] make this process easier for Residents and changes to the inspection process so repairs to individual units can happen faster.</p>
    <p><strong>Some Residents have issues that are ignored by the Tenant Association.</strong></p>
    <p>These Residents would like to know what the TA is doing on their behalf. Many of us in the building get ignored by the Tenant Association until there is an election or a giveaway. Many of us need followup with our individual needs before Margo can change the management structure of the SFHA.</p>
    <p><strong>Several Residents</strong> go to the meetings just for the lunch and don't bother to get involved beyond that.</p>
    <p><strong>Most Residents</strong> - including this group - would rather have a Walgreens or VISA gift card rather than the meal.</p>

    <h4>1760 Bush is an Income-based apartment building.</h4>
    <p>It can be confusing, but here is the breakdown at 1760 Bush. The land is owned by SFHA. John Stewart has a 99 year lease for the operation and management of the building. In order to live in this building, a person or family would first need to be qualified through SFHA under the HUD/RAD program and then refered by a social worker or SFHA.</p>
    <p>The minimum monthly rent for any tenant in this building is $25.00 a month</p>

    <h4>1760 Tenants Voted to Exit CCSD in 2016. Margo negotiated a return.</h4>
    <p><strong>From Helen Hale, Director of Housing Services</strong>, May 28, 2024</p>
    <p>&quot;1760 Bush did disaffiliate from CCSD after RAD conversion, but had been in the process of re- affiliation until the recent problems. <span class="mark">I think one of the struggles with TAs is that the residents of a building are expected by HUD to hold accountable their elected TA board members.</span>  That works well when you have relationships that work, <span class="mark">but when you have a group or even an individual who has specific ideas for their building or use of the funds then it can go a bit sideways.</span></p>
    <p>&quot;TAs are supposed to have checks and balances to manage this situation such as multiple signatures on the checking account, a majority vote at general meetings, <span class="mark"><a href="MMMexpenses.html" target="_new">a $100 limit on expenses unless general membership vote not just TA</a>,</span> a <span class="mark">quorum for the Board and at voting at their meetings</span> (at least 3 officers) and <span class="mark">elections of officers every 3 years or if folks resign or leave in the interim</span> when below quorum.</p>
    <p>&quot;As you point out there are a number of things happening here that seem of concern.  <span class="mark">Unfortunately the City doesn’t have oversight over TAs</span> just the residents of each building, but I am happy to sit down with residents if needed and talk through the process as I know CCSD members would also be available.</p>

    <h4>Disruption at a CCSD Board Meeting</h4>
    <p>During the February 2024 CCSD Board meeting, Margo denyed slandering CCSD and became disruptive when she was confronted about doing so. She declared there was a conspiracy to remove her from the Board and announced she was going to record the meeting casuing a great deal of comotion. "Fist Fighting" has yet to be verified.</p>
    <p>In the March 2024 CCSD Board meeting, a Motion for the immediate temporary suspension of Margo McNulty from CCSD membership, and to hold a Vote to Recall at the April 2024 Board Meeting. Helen Hale was present as a witness.</p>
    <p>Margo cannot tolerate any critisism, therefore is NOT prepared for politics.</p>

    <h4>Helen Hale attempted to reason with Margo</h4>
    <p>In 2022, Margo and Stephanie Pappas, Secretary at CCSD, met with Helen Hale. Ms. Hale did her best to explain the Board process and how the HUD TA's should operate. Both Ms. Hale and Ms. Pappas felt Margo understood her role as president of CCSD.</p>
    <p>Margo's vision of Democracy is on page three of <a href="WHATthe.html#SupremeMM">this document</a>.</p>

    <p>HUD/RAD encourages property owners to work together. If you have a problem with your unit or your living conditions, your first step is to contact the onsite property manager. If you do not receive satisfaction, you or, if you wish the Tenant Association, can file a complaint with evidence to the HUD Field Office.</p>
    <p>The owner is then given 30 days to respond or rectify the issue. The HUD Field Office will follow up with the property owner to ensure compliance.</p>

      <h4>SFHA and John Stewart "Condo conversion"</h4>
      <p><strong>From Helen Hale, Director of Housing Services</strong>, May 28, 2024</p>
      <p>&quot;I did notice one very important misstatement.  It is true that the RAD owners have a 99-year lease for these properties.  But they are built on land owned by SFHA which requires that they remain low income (or Affordable Housing).  Thus, owners would renew their lease or SFHA and the City (as we are partners) would find another affordable housing owner to take over ownership and operations of the property. <span class="mark">No RAD owner could convert them to market rate housing without the federal government approving that plan (which they wouldn’t as they are in the business of providing affordable housing or low-income housing).</span>  The City has regulations in place to make it difficult to sell any low-income properties to convert them to market rate buildings.  Basically the City has first right of refusal which means we have the opportunity to buy the building in order to find another affordable housing owner/operator.  So, <span class="mark">your buildings are protected by their agreement with SFHA and with the City.  We have no desire to lose any low-income buildings to market rate owners.&quot;</span></p>

    <h4>This is NOT a Legitimate Election</h4>
    <p>Both versions of <a href="TAdocs/1760_Bylaw.html" target="_new">the Bylaws</a> call for an Independent Party to preside the Election.</p>
    <div class="alert" style="padding-top: 1px;">
      <p class="myList">Article 6.4 [reprinted 2022]: <strong>At the general membership meeting were nominations are to be received or elections held, an independent thrid party, not resident in the building shall preside.<br /><br />All contested elections shall be decided by secret ballot. The election shall be conducted within HUD regulations, CCSD bylaws and regulations, and these blaws.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <p>One Board member is not an "indepenedent thrid party". Im sure if Angel tried to hold an election alone, Margo would have tossed a fit.</p>
    <p>There was no secret ballot. We all saw Margo open and count them before putting them in the Ballot Box. That disqualifies as a secret ballot.</p>
    <p>The Ballot Box cost the Tenant Association $500. Why did Margo count the votes before putting them in the Ballot Box?</p>
    <p>Leesa was paid for the last Nomination meeting. Will Margo pay herself for this Election meeting?</p>
    <p>Margo posted the results of the Election & illegally fired Angel the same night. When asked about it, Angel said "No comment." As a Resident who's known Margo for some time now, this is what Margo does when people challenge her or don't agree with everything she does.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Firing" Angel actually violates your rights to a free and fair election.<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Was the firing because Angel challenged Margo's autocratic governing style?</span></li>
      <li>Margo won't allow Angel to have the bank statements in order to do the Ledger, so he cannot be held accountable for not performing Treasurer duties</li>
      <li>Margo is targeting me because<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">I had questions about her RCA Proposal that went unanswered, so I told her I could not endorse it without learning more</span></li>
    </ul>
    <div class="row"><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
    <h4>The Nomination Meeting should have not happened</h4>
    <p>In late 2023, Margo informed the Board that part of her role at CCSD was to start a Board Officers Training to all Members and work on bringing all Members back into compliance after COVID. The 1760 Board agreed to hold nominations in September or November and elections 30 days after.</p>
    <p>The Board members wanted to have elections. 1760 Bush had not had an election for some time, so we thought having an orderly transfer of Leadership would be wise and give us an opportunity to pull our paperwork together.</p>

    <p>All the Board members were suprised when we say the flier for nominations, especially since there was no date of posting, no officer signing, and no way to determine were the flier came from.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Margo planned the Nomination and Election meetings without the knowledge of the Board</li>
      <li>Margo contracted her friend Leesa Bernhardt to Proctor<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leesa admitted to not have read either version of the Bylaws<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leesa did not know Election Meeting Protocol<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leesa did not have a full complete list of Residents</span></li>
      <li>Margo cannot be the Secretary of a Nomination Meeting</li>
      <li>Legally required 30-day notice ignored</li>
      <li>Residents who were not nominated during meeting somehow added to Nomination Posting</li>
      <li>Protocol of a HUD/RAD Tenant Association Nomination Meeting ignored.</li>
