    <h3 cla>To All Residents - July 3, 2024 </h3>
    <h4 style="border-bottom: 1px solid #777777; padding-bottom: 10px;">Angel Rittenburg, Treasurer 1760 Tenant Association,<br /><a href="./TAdocs/1760_Bylaw.html">Bylaws (2022) Article 7.9 & Bylaws (pre’02) Article 7.12</a></h4>
    <p><strong><mark>Note: No minutes exist from this meeting. There was no Scribe, Secretary, or Recorder of any type introduced to the group of people gathered at the meeting.</mark></strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>1760 TA Officers Margo McNulty, President; Vacant, Vice President; Angel Rittenburg, Treasurer; Michelle Dancer, Sergant at Arms. The Secretary of 1760 Bush had a previous commitment.</li>
      <li>Also present, <a href="imgz1760/ERmeetMMre/05252024_HAPPYmemorial.jpg" target="_new">Leesa Bernhart and Geraldo Giron, Co-Presidents of Legal Moderators Inc</a>, which is a corporation I could not find listed in the California state database for corporations registered or operating in the state. <a href="#RCAchairs">Leesa is also a chair on Margo's RCA board.</a></li>
      <li>About 30 residents and their guests showed up for the meeting, and three translators.</li>
      <li>Francis from CCSD attended as an observer to witness how this nomination meeting proceeded.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The recent nomination meeting was not conducted in accordance with HUD/RAD required procedures and regulations.</strong> As your Tenant Association Treasurer, I must outline the reasons why this nomination meeting was irregular:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><mark>Margo is the Scribe? </strong>Margo cannot serve as part of the Independent 3rd Party. CONFLICT</mark></li>
        <ol>Angel took notes after recognizing Margo was Scribe</ol>
        <li><strong><mark>NO Printed copies of any Bylaws for Attendees</mark></strong></li>
        <ol>Margo was the only one in the room with the Bylaws until Angel presented a copy Margo had delivered in a previous meeting to verify the single copy in the room</ol>
        <li><strong><mark>NO AGENDA</mark></strong> posted, printed, or made available prior to or at the meeting for Residents, Officers Michelle, the Secretary who had a prior commitment, or Angel.</li>
        <li><strong><mark>DISPLAYED IN A LOCKED CABINET</mark></strong></li>
        <ol>Partially obscured by the notices on the window and</ol>
        <ol>The document tucked behind the frame of the window.</ol> 
        <ol>Cabinet is outside of the Community Room in the Lobby.</ol>
        <li><strong><mark>NO QUALIFICATION STATEMENT BY PROCTOR</mark></strong></li>
        <ol>Did not introduce herself nor Mr Giron in any manner that would suggest they are qualified to Proctor both HUD Nomination & Election Meetings.</ol>
        <li>Ms Bernhart announced that she had already met “some of the new tenants” </li>
        <li><strong><mark>NO QUALIFICATIONS FOR OFFICER ANNOUNCED</mark></strong> or <strong><mark>QUESTION & ANSWERS</mark></strong> of any kind <strong><mark>TO FORMALIZE EVERYONE’S UNDERSTANDING</mark></strong></li>
        <li><strong><mark>MARGO CONTRACTED Mr Giron & Ms Bernhart WITHOUT BOARD KNOWLEDGE</mark>
        </strong></li>
        <ol>Announced by Angel during questioning about Rules & Procedures</ol>
        <ol>Margo did not deny nor defend that action</ol>
        <ol>Leesa & Giron listed as "Legal Moderators Inc.", </ol>
        <li><strong><mark>PROCTOR LEESA ADMITTED during Rules & Procedures ”WE ARE STILL IN TRAINING ON HOW TO DO THIS”</mark></strong></li>
        <li><strong><mark>MARGO CONTRACTED TRANSLATORS AT $85 EACH. BOTH TRANSLATORS ADVOCATED FOR MARGO TO BE THE ONLY PERSON WHO SHOULD WRITE THE BYLAWS</mark></strong></li>
        <ol>ANGEL heard them, interrupted them to verify if they were Residents. The Chinese translator said <span style="font-style: italic; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 212); margin: 3px;">“No Margo paid us to be here”</span></ol>
        <li>MARGO WALKED OUT OF MEETING AFTER “Nominations” but, BEFORE ADJOURNMENT. Scribe???</li>
        <ol>When Margo returned, Angel questioned Proctor Leesa “Did we adjourn? Is that why Margo walked out and came back in?”</ol>
        <ol>Leesa then adjourned the meeting.</ol>
        <ol>No Next Steps discussed, No Timeline explained.</ol>
        <li><strong><mark>PROCTOR ADJOURNED MEETING BEFORE EXPLAINING ”NEXT STEPS”, WHEN THE ELECTION WAS, WHAT TO EXPECT FOR THE NEXT 30 DAYS, WHAT CANTIDATES ARE ALLOWED TO DO AND WHO TO TALK TO, AND ABOVE ALL, MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD THE PROCESS, WHO WAS NOMINATED, AND WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN DURING THE NEXT 30 DAYS.
        </mark></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>NOTE: Immediately after the Proctor announced "Nominations open," Margo shouted "I nominate myself for president! Next!"</p>
    <p>Some people ask, "Is this a valid action?" The answer is YES. Individuals are allowed to nominate any person who qualifies to hold office for that office, including themselves.</p>
    <p>The Board made <strong>several attempts</strong> to work with Margo. To the best of our knowledge, no one has yet asked her to step down. <strong><mark>We want the Board to act in compliance with current HUD/RAD, the current <a href="" target="_new">Code of Federal Regulations</a>, provide an annual budget, conduct open public meetings we are guaranteed to by law, and conduct a proper nominations and elections process with a true Independent 3rd Party, we suggest SFHA.</mark></strong></p>
