      <p>CCSD asked for accountability from Margo for over six months. Margo responded with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A public display of hostility & disrespect to CCSD Affiliates, the Board, & the process of conducting CCSD business</li>
        <li>Name calling, yelling, & harassment, of Attendees</li>
        <li>Margo knew she was going to be recalled and chose to submit a Letter of Resignation</li>

        <p>A: <strong>&quot;I have not approved anything (nor is it within my role to do so).  I have not heard that SFHA has taken that step either.  I do not believe they would create a body as all the owners and likely the City would need to agree to the plan too.&quot;</strong></p>

      <p>Here are <a href="./TAdocs/1760_Bylaw.html" target="_new">the Bylaws as posted</a> in the Community Bulletin Board case outside the meeting.</p>
      <p>This version of Bylaws has Election</p>
      <hr />
      <p>Bylaws 6.3: The "Secretary shall be responsible for ensuring that the members receive fifteen to thirty days written notice of membership meetings where nominations are to be made and the election held."</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Margo is not the Secretary and Federal Law states such notice is 30-days.</li>
        <li>Margo posted extra names on the Nomination List she wrote, printed, and posted in public</li>
        <li>Margo claimed one nominee ineligible because they previously resigned from the Board, but<br />allowed John to be included as a nominee. John resigned as VP last year.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>Within a couple of hours after the notice was posted, the extra names were crossed off with a pen.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>Bylaws 6.4: "At the general membership meeting where nominations are to be received or elections held, an independent third party, not resident in the building shall preside."</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Margo did all this without including Michelle or Angel. We have not been able to contact Zia, so we don't know what she knew yet.</li>
        <li>Margo picked her friend Leesa Bernhart to be the "Independent Party"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Leesa admitted to not having seen or read our Bylaws<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerard or Lessa did not have a copy of the Bylaws at the meeting<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leesa admitted she was "still in training"</span></li>
        <li>As a resident in the building, Margo can not be part of the Proctor Team.<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margo took notes for the Proctor</span></li>
