    <h3 cla>To All Residents - July 3, 2024 </h3>
    <h4 style="border-bottom: 1px solid #777777; padding-bottom: 10px;">Angel Rittenburg, Treasurer 1760 Tenant Association,<br /><a href="./TAdocs/1760_Bylaw.html">Bylaws (2022) Article 7.9 & Bylaws (pre’02) Article 7.12</a></h4>
    <p>It has come to our attention that the recent election meeting organized by Margo was not conducted in accordance with HUD/RAD required procedures and regulations. As your Tenant Association Treasurer, I must outline the reasons why this election is invalid:</p>
    <p><strong>1.	Lack of Independent Third Party <a href="./TAdocs/1760_Bylaw.html">(Article 6.3):</a></strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Margo is not an independent party and as a Nominee cannot serve as the only official for an election.</li>
      <li>Leesa Bernhardt publicly admitted her team is not qualified to conduct Nominations or Elections</li>
      <li>Margo counted the votes prior to depositing them in the Ballot Box.</li>
      <li>Margo controls the keys to the Ballot Box.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>2.	No Verification of Residency Before Ballot Distribution <a href="./TAdocs/1760_Bylaw.html">(Article 6.4):</a></strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Proper verification of residency was not conducted before distributing ballots.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-24/subtitle-B/chapter-IX/part-964/subpart-E/section-964.420" target="_new">HUD requires a 30-day notice, not the 15-day notice that was given [24 CFR § 964.420(b)]</a><br /><strong>&quot;The public housing agency must provide residents with at least 30 days advance notice for nominations and elections. The notice should include a description of the election procedures, eligibility requirements, and dates of nominations and elections. Any election procedures devised by the public housing agency must facilitate fair elections.&quot;</strong></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-24/subtitle-B/chapter-IX/part-964/subpart-B/section-964.130" target="_new">Election Procedures and Standards</a><br /><strong>&quot;The resident council shall use an independent third-party to oversee elections and recall procedures.&quot;</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>3.	Inclusion of Disqualified Nominees:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>During the nomination meeting, Margo stated that Eric and John, who had previously resigned, could not run for office. Despite this, they were included in the post meeting flier & election.</li>
      <li>Nominees included who where not nominated or interested in office</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>4.	Post-Election Irregularities:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Margo called Michelle an hour before the board meeting to inform her she received only two out of 35 votes, and then claimed to have voted for her</li>
      <li>Margo posted notices claiming to have removed Angel from the board on the same evening as the election. This violates Your Right to a Fair Election and ignores both of Margo’s Bylaws (2022) Article 7.9 & Bylaws (pre’02) Article 7.12</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>5.	Board Composition Concerns:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The board has been replaced with members Margo has chosen and who are aligned with her actions as president, potentially allowing unchecked control over decisions, including financial matters.</li>
      <li>The election process and scheudling appears to have been structured to support an agenda unaligned with the needs of the residents at 1760 Bush Street.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, it is crucial to adhere to the following federal regulations under 24 CFR § 964.150(b):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Funding for Tenant Participation: Public Housing Agencies must provide funding to support the activities of duly elected resident councils and ensure effective resident participation in decision-making processes.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Moreover, all board meetings must be open to tenants in compliance with 24 CFR § 964.420 to ensure transparency and allow residents to be fully informed and engaged in the decision-making process.</p>
    <p>We request that Margo adheres to the established rules and regulations, including making all board meetings open to tenants and complying with federal guidelines to ensure fair and transparent elections. Failure to comply with these standards will necessitate further action.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Treasurer, 1760 Bush HUD/RAD Tenant Association</p>
