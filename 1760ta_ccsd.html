        <h2>March 2024 - Margo Recalled as Interm President</h2>
        <h3>March 28, 2024</h3>
        <h3>Margaret McNulty, Appointed January 25, 2024- for the remainder of the year.</h3>
        <h3></h3>
        <h3>As our interim president, Margaret has acted independently of the Board, without any prior discussion or approval.</h3>
        <h3>Despite our objections to this behavior at the February Board meeting, it has been brought to our attention that Margaret has held additional meetings and discussions at affiliate buildings which the Board had no prior knowledge of nor the opportunity to attend.</h3>
        <h3>Margaret has slandered this Board as "dysfunctional" and disorganized to both SFHA and Affiliate members and residents, as she has collected signatures to promote her 'paid oversight committee' based on defaming us.</h3>
        <h3>This malicious and deceitful behavior, and the conflict of interest it creates, demonstrate that Margaret does not have the best interests of CCSD , or its membership in her mind.</h3>
        <h3>CCSD Board Member detailed concerns about the behavior of interim President Margaret McNutly March 28, 2024</h3>
        <h3>Appointed as our interim president for the remainder of 2024 by the CCSD Board on January 25th ( after a six month probationary period), Margaret seems to misunderstand her role as chair of our Board. She has acted without the board's prior knowledge or consent, and created a hostile environment in which she threatens to expose her detractors for losing professionalism in the face of her game playing.</h3>
        <h3>Here are some highlights of a longer list of circumstances and situations:</h3>
        <div class="myList">
        <h3>1)	Tried to conduct business to half the Board by text and emails;</h3>
        <h3>2)	Went behind the Board's collective back and acted without our knowledge- let alone agreement or consensus - many times</h3>
        <h4>a)	Including writing letters about MOU contracts to SFHA and HUD that the board still hasn't seen; despite our asking; and</h4>
        <h4>b)	Including efforts to form a "compensated" oversight committee that sits above CCSD and its members.</h4>
        <h3>3)	Acted unilaterally, for example: Overruled three elections committee members by stating "I am approving" the weekend meetings (which MM had scheduled.) Made her own fliers versus the standard ones created by the secretary. Has not shown us a copy of that flier as requested.</h3>
        <h3>4)	Gave less than 48 hour’s notice to board members (to 4 of us, by text) of the consulting meeting with Brytebridge the 5013c (Wed. afternoon for Friday midday) then complained later that no one attended it with her.</h3>
        <h3>5)	Scheduled weekend meetings, and last month the Board asked for them to be rescheduled, but STILL have no reports of the new dates, or if Margaret held a nominations meeting on March 9, 2024, with President Elizabeth Jones at 2698 California Street, or not, despite asking her directly by email.</h3>
        <h3>6)	Declared herself our "governing officer" and made demands based upon this position, and;</h3>
        <h3>7)	Focused on and fueled argument with one board member versus hearing the concerns of the majority of Board: cannot talk to us directly, but demands 'mediation,' which we see as a tactic, not a sincere wish to communicate better, and;</h3>
        <h3>8)	Called the Board's concerns "nonsense" and "lies," repeatedly.</h3>
        <h3>9)	Canceled a proctoring assignment at Woodside meeting about a week out; then stated the next day that "the interpreters can't make it either." (ALL three?) Fortunately, she gave us a week's notice and didn't try to sabotage the meeting the day before it was scheduled. We were able to regroup. This move would have hurt Woodside residents and no one else, and;</h3>
        <h3>10)	Lied to the board about recording the contentious February Board Meeting. When exposed to the rest of the board- by her threats afterwards to share the recording with SFHA Commissioners- she then claimed that she had only recorded us "In [her] mind."</h3>
        <h3>11)	Insisted it was OK to record us, and insisted all future meetings will be recorded and we may not object because our small, PRIVATE Board meetings are, in fact, PUBLIC events with no expectation of Privacy- even when we had just voted to go into "Private Session." Even though the majority of us disagree with her. She declares what will be done!</h3>
        <h3>12)	Engaged in name-calling ("Gestapo"), mocked with hand gestures, and generally talked over everyone who tried to share their concerns, yet she feels the need to expose others' behavior as problematic!?!</h3>
        <h3>13)	Slandered and defamed fellow CCSD officers as “dysfunctional and disorganized” to outside Agencies and Affiliate members at meetings with city officials.</h3>
        <h3>14)	Secret meetings that the Board did not know about until after- when it was reported by residents; has made no effort to even discuss with Board members.</h3>
        <h3>15)	Enlisted our Chinese language interpreter, hired for Rosa Parks Nominations meeting, to collect signatures for her petition/proposal defaming CCSD (which casts a pall over all of the signatures on her list).</h3>
        <h3>16)	Allegedly dismissed an Affiliate Resident's concerns at a secret meeting when the Resident asked "Where is the rest of the Board?", Margo answered "I am the president," inferring Margo does not feel the need to include the Board in her dealings.</h3>
        <h3>17)	When we successfully kept our February Board Meeting argument out of the General Membership Meeting that followed it, after the meeting Margaret loudly confronted [CCSD Secretary] Stephanie Pappas about "mediation" and then talked over her answer, in front of several general members who were milling about, reigniting the fight and causing an outburst from Stephanie. (Perhaps to promote her petition of alleged "dysfunction"?)</h3>
        <h3>18)	Margo used our Chinese language interpreter to collect signatures from Chinese speakers who did not know what they were signing. The interpreter said her supervisor, Margaret, asked her to collect signatures, so she was doing as she was told! The plain page looked like a regular meeting sign-in sheet with the word "petition" handwritten at the top of it.</h3>
        <h3>19)	Insisted on Friday night and Saturday texts to Board members ( half of us, remember) when we said we don't want to work weekends-- but she wants to 'work 24/7' so, we ALL have to. Seemed like trying to provoke angry responses by repeatedly doing this behavior.</h3>
        <h3>20)	Wrote us an apology letter (June 2023) for leaving CCSD after losing the election in which she promised to make her presidency "a group effort," and that she would "listen, listen and listen some more," but instead, has held NO discussions with us at all prior to going out and "representing "us- we thought as our TEAM MEMBER, but instead it seems she has chosen to portray us in a very negative light.</h3>
        <h3>21)	Doesn't know the rules, guidelines or regulations. For example allowed incorrect bylaws at 1760 Bush and then spread those bastardized bylaws as training materials despite being shown the proper bylaws that we were giving to Affiliates. When asked about it, said that she had "inherited" those bylaws- so it wasn't her fault. She has a responsibility to understand how things are supposed to work and take care not to give out incorrect information.</h3>
        <h3>22)	Margaret has been disloyal to this Board and should not be allowed to further represent this group- we just cannot trust her after these actions of telling everyone that we are disorganized and dysfunctional. Spreading lies about why Peter left after only three months. She was not here, she does not know.</h3>
        <h3>23)	We could go on, but the main reasons for our discontent are listed herein.</h3>
