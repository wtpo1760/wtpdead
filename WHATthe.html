    <h3>2016 - 2022: Catch-up after COVID, Margo brings 1760 Bush back to CCSD</h3>
    <div class="col-sm-6"><p><strong><mark>In 2016</mark></strong>, a Quorum [a minimum of 15 qualified 18 year old Residents] of Residents attended a General Meeting of 1760 Bush Street and voted to exit CCSD.</p>
    <p><strong><mark>In 2022</mark></strong>, Margo negotiated with then CCSD President Dennis to bring 1760 back to CCSD and was appointed Interm Secretary by Dennis to finish the 2022 term.</p>
    <p><strong><mark>In 2022</mark></strong>, Margo reaffirmed 1760 Bush's return to CCSD and committing 1760 Bush's Tech Funds to CCSD. [This is often refered to as a fee, but it is not. HUD mandates a portion of HUD funds be set aside as "Tech Funds" designated for Nominations & Elections and other functionary duties required to operate the Tenant Association democratically.]</p>
    <p><strong><mark>In March 2023</mark></strong>, Margo was appointed to a CCSD Committee to facilitate the other Affiliated Tenant Associations out of dormancy from the Lockdown by helping Tenants and Boards re-engage, catch up with compliance, prepare for the upcoming 2025 version of the HUD/RAD program, and offer an "Officer Training" to help Tenants understand what the Tenant Association Officers do and hopefully find Tenants interested in serving on a Board.</p>
    <p>The Committee appointment came with a six-month probation to ensure "we had a good fit" before appointing Margo the Interm President.</p>
    <p><strong><mark>In January 2024</mark></strong>, Margo announced she was appointed Interm President of CCSD.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-danger">

    <p><strong><mark>In April 2024</strong>, CCSD Board voted to <a href="CCSDrecall.html">Recall the Iterm President of CCSD</mark></a> in the May 2024 Monthly Meeting.</p>

        <p>Over the summer of 2023, Margo had shared with the Board that she felt she "was a good fit with CCSD" and the committee had started their work.</p>
        <p>She said CCSD and her were working on developing a Board Officer Training session to start around August or September. She suggested we encourage all Tenants to attend those sessions so Tenants could understand what the Board is, what it does, and hopefully bring new people in for the roles.</p>

            <h4>Elections are important and should be treated with professionalism and respect, not contempt and facades.</h4>
            <p>Residents Rights should be honored and defended by the Board, not rewritten to fit any <a href="#SupremeMM">one person's megalomaniacal ambitions</a>.</p>
            <p>I pointed out to Margo that <a href="#30dayNotice">by law you must give 30-day notice</a>, she scuffed at the the requirement and started to bully me for disloyalty, name call, challenge my mental condition, and threaten to fire me as Treasurer.</p>
            <p>I asked Margo many times to include the rest of the Board in this process. She ultimately refused and claimed "the president of any organization is the governing body"</p>
            <p>After careful consideration and requests from other Residents, Angel chose to release some of the transcript of text messages between Angel, Margo, Michelle, and the board secretary.</p>

        <h2>After a couple days, we had an Emergency Board Meeting to address the issue.</h2>
        <p>We met in Michelle's apartment.</p>
        <p>We each reminded Margo she acted without at least a phone call or text before she posted the flier. We all gave Margo a chance to include us moving forward, we never asked to stop the process, just to ensure that we comply with the Code of Federal Regulations. We all left and after we all seemed to get along very well.</p>
        <p>I thought we all were heard, and all had a chance to "get it all out".</p>
        <p>About an hour after the meeting ended, I knocked on Margo's door to present her a gift as a symbol of respect and cooperation after the earlier meeting.</p>
        <h4>The morning after the Emergency Board Meeting, the 3 page note below was taped outside of my front door in an envelope.</h4>
        <p><span class="mark">I chose to share the note because this is about the Nomination and Election Margo called, technically open to all Residents of 1760 Bush.</span></p>
